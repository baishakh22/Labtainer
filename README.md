# Labtainer
Naval Postgraduate School


Fully packaged Linux-based computer science lab exercises with an initial emphasis on cybersecurity. 
I Muhfat Alam, done some lab work on labtainer. It gives me a hand on experiences with cybersecurity tools. 

## Copy FIle
I have trouble with copying a file from the labtainer to my local machine. After opening a lab on the labtainer, I saw some files which I feel like important to save on my local machine. But somehow, I couldn’t get success. The reason was, I can’t copy the file directly from the labtainer lab to my local machine.
To copy a file,
I need to copy from my labtainer lab to my labtainer machine. 

First, go to the file directory, where my file is located. 
Then, type the following command
```
scp bot.py stduent@192.168.0.1:/home/student/labtainer/trunk/scripts/labtainer-student
```

This will ask for the password, Password will be the password for your main labtainer machine, which is
Password: **password123**
